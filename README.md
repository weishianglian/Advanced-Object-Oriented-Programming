# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
## Inheritance
* A form of software reuse
  * create a class that absorbs an existing class's data and behaviours 
  * enhances them with new capabilities
  * avoiding duplicating code
* The existing class is called the base class, and the new class is referred to as the derived class (a more specialise group of objects).
* It is the is-a relationship represents inheritance.
* C++ offers public, protected and private inheritance.
